Deletes node at the particular position.

**deleteAll(element: Character)**
Deletes all nodes from the list by value.

**get(index: Integer)**
Getting node by particular position.

**clone()**
Creates a copy of the list.

**reverse()**
Reversing the list.

**findFirst(element: Character)**
Finds the first node in the list and returns the position.

**findLast(elenent: Character)**
Finds the last node in the list and returns the position.
